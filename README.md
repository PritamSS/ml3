# DATA ANALYSIS OF HEART PATIENTS
Data analysis is a vast field with innumerable real-world applications. In this project the aim is to select a dataset and analyze the data which is useful to gain an insight about the dataset.



Finally, predictive models were built using some standard machine learning algorithms and their accuracies compared.





## Dataset Overview

The dataset chosen was about heart disease with 918 datapoints and here we try to determine how different parameters determine whether the patient under consideration is positive. This problem was addressed by plotting various graphs and visualizing the data. 

### Context
Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.
People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

### Attribute information
1.	Age: age of the patient [years]
2.	Sex: sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]
3.	ChestPainType: chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]
4.	RestingBP: resting blood pressure [mm Hg]
5.	Cholesterol: serum cholesterol [mm/dl]
6.	FastingBS: fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]
7.	RestingECG: resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]
8.	MaxHR: maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]
9.	ExerciseAngina: exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]
10.	Oldpeak: oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]
11.	ST_Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]
12.	HeartDisease: output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]
